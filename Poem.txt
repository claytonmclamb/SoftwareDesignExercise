Roses are Red
Violets are Blue
I love this class
and you should too.
In lines of code, the mind does play,
A dance of logic, night and day.
With keys and screens, we shape and mold,
A silent symphony, brave and bold.
Apples are red
I got lost in the shed.
When you lose your shoe
It's probably blue.
In lines of code, the world takes shape,
A dance of logic, dreams escape.
With every bug, new skills ignite,
A quest for truth in endless night.
